The process of connecting to an exporter and pulling the metrics into
prometheus is called as Scrapping


A Push Gateway is a component of Prometheus which acts as a temporary storage where applications can send metrics into it and 
it has a built-in exporter so prometheus can also scrape the information from Push Gateway 

Node Exporter:
    -  Node based exporter is an official prometheus exporter for collecting
    metrics that are exposed by Unix-based kernels, ex. Linux and Ubuntu
    - Example of metrics are CPU, Disk, Memory and Network I/O
    - Node Exporter can be extended with Pluggable metric collectors
